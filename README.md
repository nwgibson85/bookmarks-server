# Node.js server for Bookmarks-Api

This is a Node.js server created from my boilerplate project used for starting new Node.js projects!

## Capabilities
get '/bookmarks' (retrieve the full bookmarks array)
post '/bookmarks' (post a new bookmark to the array)
get by id '/bookmarks/:id' (retrieve a single bookmark by id)
delete '/bookmarks/:id' (delete a single bookmark from the array based on id)
